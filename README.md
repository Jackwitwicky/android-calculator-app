## How it Works

The app is made up of a single activity ```MainActivity``` that contains all the math operations.

### Display Section

This is the pink view that is divided into 2 sections. The first is used to hold a view of the full arithmetic expression that 
has been input by the user. The view below it, which is in larger font is the current input that the user is entering.

### Command Section

The top section of the view is composed of the key arithmetic operations, including and currently limited to:- 

* Division
* Multiplication
* Percentage


The right section of the action view is composed various commands and the remaining arithmetic operations including :-

* CLEAR - This is used to clear the content that has currently been input by the user
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Delete - This is used to remove the most recent input by the user
* Equals - Performs the arithmetic that is contained in the input view.
